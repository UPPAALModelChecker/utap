	* : utap: fixed FP usage detection for function calls

2019-03-06  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : build: options and scripts for compiling on mac.  Mac uses '@'
	character in linker flags so it confuses the scripts, thus I changed
	all the option files to use '|' instead of '@' ('|' is unlikely to
	be used by anyone due to its connotation with a pipe in shell).

2018-12-21  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : engine: added many distributions to sample from: arcsine, beta,
	gamma, poisson, weibull, tri (triangular)

	need to specify #runs if just one simulation is needed)

2018-06-07  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : SMC: fixed histogram when DoF<1, cleaned up compiler warnings

2018-06-06  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : SMC: refactored the property syntax and added a possibility to
	specify the explicit number of runs uniformly, breaks "simulate"
	query syntax

2018-04-12  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : fixed some undefined-behavior by refactoring variable-vector API

2018-02-02  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	if-the-else statements in a row added C++11 "override" to virtual
	functions and fixed some

2017-06-02  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : utap: fixed parsing of xml files without queries and formulas
	with line breaks

2015-03-13  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : build: added windows launcher, changed to console executable
	(hopefully there will fewer streange crashes on windows) and other
	small fixes

	cross-compile boost and libxml2 for win32.

2014-05-22  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Check that dynamic constructs are only used on edges, throw type
	error if a template is referenced in a dynamic construct before
	being defined, ensure to delete the process variables when they go
	out of scope i.e. for sum (t:T)(e) t is only bound for the
	expression e

2014-05-21  Wei Zhao <zhaow@cs.aau.dk>

	* : The xml format for queries using in command line:
	<formula>..</formula> instead of <property> .. </property>

2014-05-19  Wei Zhao <zhaow@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Get the functionality of the runtime error for the symbolic
	simulator. If a runtime error happens during query verification, the
	GUI now understands whether the error happened in the model or in
	the query expression. The error message is shown correctly.

2014-04-09  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* : made plotting of arbitrary clock expressions (guard and
	invariants) work

2014-04-09  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Allowed use of references in instantiation of dynamic templates
	(to allow  channels as parameters).

2013-10-24  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* : proper toString for the dynamic expressions

2013-10-24  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* : The function random is not computable at compile time.

2013-08-22  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Added support for double. EXPERIMENTAL Changed semantics of
	meta.  Updated reftests: meta variables are not printed any more,
	0,1 printed as false,true when applicable. Some stupid spaces are
	also gone.

2013-04-16  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed bug in VM. Added warning.

2013-03-06  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed a segfault. At least detect and work-around it. The true
	source of the bug has not been fixed.

2013-02-14  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed parsing of double.  Handle exponential rate <= 0. I did
	NOT want to do this but sometimes it is difficult to write the
	proper guards (may be arbitrary expressions).

2012-12-06  Danny B. Poulsen <dannybp@cs.aau.dk>

	* :     Changed Syntax for mitl (MITL keyword has been replaced by Pr).      Introduced shorthand for box and diamond operator in mitl.

2012-09-24  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed precedence problem.

2012-08-20  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : fixed some compiler warnings (and some potential bug about
	nested function calls: when the outer function is void then it did
	not mark its beginning, where its arguments are stored, see
	program.cpp)

2012-08-08  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Added + operator for Ecdar.

2012-05-09  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	working against the GUI, Marius will fix this.

2011-11-24  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed bugs in smc.  Added XML_PARSE_RECOVER.

2011-10-11  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed overflow problem against the GUI. No clue why this shows
	up only in some version of ecdar and not elsewhere.

2010-03-18  Arild Martin M¯ller Haugstad <arild@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Experimental CMake-based alternative build-system for server

2009-12-09  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : TIGA: Changed syntax for simulation properties. Now it's more a
	more natural (A || B) <= C ... kind of syntax.  UPPAAL: Added
	support for clock constraints on receiving broadcast
	synchronizations. The simulators (server) had to be fixed too. The
	GUIs are not affected.

2009-11-13  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Removed explicit enumeration.

2009-11-03  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed side-effect asserts.  Fixed compilation for Windows.

2009-10-20  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Implemented consistency checking.  Updated transition filter for
	open systems.  Added fed_t::getBounded().

2009-10-05  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Changed the semantics of simulation games. Now UPPAAL considers
	simulation of open systems. When there is a synchronization, it is
	typed in the sense that a broadcast sync is different from a binary
	sync, which is different from a "half" sync.  Simulation is using
	the sync label now, taking full advantage of the syntax.  The action
	label is ignored for simulation checking.  Updated test suite to
	reflect the syntax change.  Bumped version number.  Changed internal
	coding of the turned-based variable for simulation checking.
	Changed syntax of the property, it is now prefixed by "simulation:".
	I will add "refinement:" soon.  Separated code for the
	transitions+successors from the Transition/Successor-Filter files.
	The change is now more significant.  Added a place holder for a
	future copy constructor of TA systems (utap).

2009-09-28  Sandie Balaguer <sandie@cs.aau.dk>

	* : 

2009-08-26  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Added a comment in HashTable.  Removed dead code and useless
	variables.

2009-08-11  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed bug 469.

2009-06-25  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed bug 474.

2009-05-14  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Added support for Gantt charts in the server.  Fixed simulation
	game: * distinguish (un)controllable actions to duplicate * take into account forced actions

2009-04-25  Arild Martin M¯ller Haugstad <arild@cs.aau.dk>

	* : prob: new query property; Pmax

2009-03-19  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed assert.

2009-03-18  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed bug 465.

2009-03-16  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Added functionality to AbstractJob to store expressions.  Added
	functionality to ModelChecker to return feedbacks.  Added handling
	of "sup: list of expr" property (with expr being state predicate
	without side-effect or clock constraints or clock names).  Fixed
	traces for leadsto. This is a theoretical fix since the bug has not
	appeared yet.  Somewhat updated other checkers to handle the
	changes, they may be broken.  Added a functionality to the DBM lib
	to handle sup properties easily.

2009-03-10  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Removed previous inf & sup.  Started to add support for (new)
	sup.

2009-03-03  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Made possible to print states with federations.  Added 'sum' to
	the language, same syntax as exists & forall but limited to integer
	expressions only.  It's very useful in tctl expressions when ranging
	over processes.

2009-03-02  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Removed implementation for Mani's robust reachability algorithm.

2009-01-26  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : fixed C string library header inclusion problem (GCC 4.3
	complains)

2008-12-19  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : fixed partially poor performance with many locations in the
	model.  Fix is trivial, but the parsing performance gain is more
	than 2x (according to gprof).  This is due to stupid std::list::size
	implementation which should be avoided as plague.  Next, Symbol::add
	in system/Symbol.cpp should be redesigned, which now naively seeks
	to the end of the linked list just to add a new sibling.

2008-10-20  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Extended the typechecker to accept x'==integral instead of
	x'==integer. It is a natural extension when considering that bool
	and x' expressions have the same range.

2008-10-03  Arild Martin M¯ller Haugstad <arild@cs.aau.dk>

	* : branching edges partially supported in server (with
	ENABLE_BRANCHING) Combination with select will not currently work, support for
	simulator is missing, and there is a bug in the dot-formatting when
	replying to getTransitions.  (while the problem with getTransitions is related to the previous
	point --- simulator support not yet considerd/implemented --- the
	GUI will also call getTransitions at various other points, notably
	right after calling modelCheck...)

2008-09-26  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Extended control_t* to work with default parameters.

2008-09-09  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : removed redundant typedef (warned by g++-4.3.1)

2008-09-05  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Updated localization.

2008-09-03  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Starting to localize parser errors.  Still need to do some
	replacements for parser.cc.

2008-08-01  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed compilation with i586-mingw32msvc-g++.

2008-07-31  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Reject clock differences too.

2008-07-31  aymie <aymie@3b6c4bc8-9f06-0410-8197-9f1a2e675645>

	* : Changed the location of the mapping of PO Tiga actions to the
	compiler and solved some segfault issues.

2008-07-30  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Fixed a warning in modelchecker.cpp.  Fixed parsing of
	observations.

2008-07-16  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Removed AF2, AG2, EG2, and EF2 types of quantifiers.  They were
	work-in-progress that have been there for too long.  Fixed minor
	printing bug for control properties.  Added properties for PO Tiga.
	Added bootstrap code for PO Tiga.

2008-06-11  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	* : Improved warning message.

2008-04-25  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : attempt to fix bug 428: allow typechecker to accept (guard ||
	integral) expressions as (integral || guard) are accepted. Same
	applies to invariants.

2008-02-21  Marius Mikuƒçionis <marius@cs.aau.dk>

	* : compilation fix for gcc-3.4.5 (workaround for strchrnul, since
	it is not in 3.4.5)

2007-12-12  Alexandre David <adavid@cs.aau.dk>

	(needed for the structural equivalence check).

2006-02-27  John HÂkansson <john@it.uu.se>

	* : - Changed the syntax of ChanElement to be a ChanExpression or
	T_DEFAULT.  - Expressions are type checked to make sure that they indeed resolve
	to channels or arrays of channels.  - Changed the representation in TimedAutomataSystem to provide a
