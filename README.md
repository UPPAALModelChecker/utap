## 1. What is libutap

libutap is the Uppaal Timed Automata Parser. Uppaal is an integrated
tool environment for designing, simulating and verifying real time
systems modeled as extended timed automata. `libutap` is the parser for
Uppaal documents.

libutap has the ability to parse and type check Uppaal models in any
of the three file formats supported by Uppaal.

libutap is licensed under the LGPL.

## 2. Compiling

Use `cmake` to compile `libutap` easily for various platforms.
You will need GCC version 10 or newer, Ninja or GNU make,
and `libxml2` from [XMLSoft](https://www.xmlsoft.org) (at least version 2.6.10).

Install the developer tools:
```shell
sudo apt-get install g++ ninja-build cmake
```

Install the tools and libraries:
```shell
sudo apt-get install flex bison libxml2-dev doctest-dev
```

Configure UTAP:
```shell
cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MYPATH -G Ninja # to install to $MYPATH, e.g. /usr/local
```
Compile UTAP:
```shell
cmake --build build
```
Run unit tests:
```sh
cd build
ctest
```

Install UTAP to `$MYPATH`:
```
cmake --install build
```

## Compile from scratch (almost)

Alternatively compile the bison and libraries for your target platform (see `cmake/toolchain/*.cmake` for list), e.g.:
```shell
./getlibs/getlibs.bash linux64
```

Compile and test UTAP:
```shell
./compile.sh linux64
```

For other platforms please see [compile.sh](compile.sh) script:
```sh
./compile.sh [linux64] [linux64-gcc10] [linux32] [win64] [win32] [darwin] [darwin-brew-gcc10]
```
Where
- `win64` requires `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++` from [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (either from Linux distribution or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)).

- `win32` requires `i686-w64-mingw32-g++` from [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) (either from Linux distribution or [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)).

- `linux32` requires `g++-multilib`.

- `darwin` requires [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and its `Command Line Tools` installed.

- `darwin-brew-gcc10` in addition to `XCode` requires [gcc-10](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc@10) with 

- `getlibs` script requires `sha256sum` from [coreutils](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils) (then add `/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin` to `PATH`).

## 3. Simple Use Case

There are two ways one can use the library. In its simplest form, one
calls one of the top level parsing functions defined in [utap/utap.h](src/utap/utap.h),
e.g. `example.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "utap/utap.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    UTAP::Document doc;
    int res = parse_XML_file("myfile.xml", &doc, true);
    std::cout << "Result: " << res << std::endl;
}
```

The first argument is the file to read. The second is the output of
the parser and the third is a flag indicating whether we want to use
the new or the old syntax (the old syntax is the one used in Uppaal
3.4, the new is the one that will be used since Uppaal 3.6).

After the call to `parse_XML_file`, one can access the network of timed
automata in the system variable. Take a look at [utap/system.h](src/utap/system.h) to see
what kind of structures you can access.
Distribution also includes [pretty.cpp](src/pretty.cpp) for pretty-printing model files.
See also doxygen API documentation in [doc/api/index.html](doc/api/index.html).

Use the following command to compile the example:

```sh
g++ example.cpp -o example -lutap -lxml2
```

If UTAP was configured with `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MYPATH` to install in custom location
then use the following to compile:

```sh
g++ -I$MYPATH/include example.cpp -o example -L$MYPATH/lib -lutap -lxml2
```

### Use Case with CMake
Add the following `CMakeLists.txt` build script:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22)
project(Example CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)
set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

find_package(UTAP 2.1.0 QUIET)

if (utap_FOUND)
  message(STATUS "Found UTAP preinstalled.")
else(utap_FOUND)
  message(STATUS "Failed to find UTAP, will fetch and compile from source.")
  include(FetchContent)
  FetchContent_Declare(
    UTAP
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/UPPAALModelChecker/utap.git
    GIT_TAG v2.1.0      # fetches version 2.1.0, alternatively try 'main' branch
    GIT_SHALLOW TRUE  # get only the last commit version
    GIT_PROGRESS TRUE # show progress of download
    FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS NAMES UTAP
    USES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD TRUE # show progress in ninja generator
    USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE ON
    USES_TERMINAL_BUILD ON
    USES_TERMINAL_INSTALL ON
    LOG_DOWNLOAD ON
    LOG_CONFIGURE ON
    LOG_BUILD ON
    LOG_INSTALL ON
    LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE ON)
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(UTAP)
endif(utap_FOUND)
```

Then the UTAP can be linked with `example` like this:
```cmake
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE UTAP)
```

Configure:
```shell
cmake -B build .
```
Compile:
```shell
cmake --build build
```
Run:
```shell
./build/example
```

## 4. Parsing Uppaal Trace Files

`verifyta` utility from Uppaal distribution (`bin-*` folder) is able to print traces in human readable format (see `verifyta -h` and in particular keys `-t` and `-f`, also `-X` can produce `xml`).

If a custom format or some kind of transformation is needed, UTAP includes `tracer` utility which can parse and print trace files in human readable form. The source is included, thus the output can be modified accordingly.

First, `tracer` needs an `.if` file -- an intermediate format representation of the same model that was used to produce the trace. The `.if` file is produced by `verifyta` utility from Uppaal distribution:
```sh
UPPAAL_COMPILE_ONLY=1 verifyta model.xml > model.if
```
Then `tracer` can be applied as follows:
```sh
tracer model.if trace.xtr
```

</pre>

The BNF implemented by the bison generated parser is split into
several sections and to some extend duplicated for the old and new
syntax. It can read `.ta` and `.xta` files directly. `XML` files are read
using the `libxml2` library. Each text-block in the `XML` file is then
parser wrt. the BNF for that block (see [xmlreader.cpp](src/xmlreader.cpp)). For this, the
`bison` generated parser is reused.

The parser calls methods in the abstract `ParserBuilder` class. The
methods in the `ParserBuilder` class are implemented by the
SystemBuilder class which is a subclass of ExpressionBuilder which is
a subclass of `AbstractBuilder`. The `SystemBuilder` writes the model to
an instance of the `TimedAutomataSystem` (TAS) class.

The design abstracts the differences between the `.xml`, `.xta` and `.ta`
input formats and also hides the differences between the 3.4 and
3.6/4.0 formats from any implementation of the `ParserBuilder` interface
(for equivalent input the parser will call the same methods in the
ParserBuilder class).

A TAS object represents the templates, variables, locations,
transitions and processes of a model. Symbols are represented by
`symbol_t` objects (see the API documentation). A symbol is a name (a
string) with a type. The type is represented by a `type_t`
object. Symbols are grouped into frames (represented by `frame_t`
objects). Frames are used to represent scopes and other collections of
symbols such as records or parameters of templates and functions.

All expressions are represented using a tree structure where the
leaves represent values or variables and the inner nodes represent
operations. Each node is referenced using an `expression_t` object.
