New in 0.90

This is the version of UTAP used in UPPAAL 3.6 Beta 3.  The tracer
utility no longer uses libutap. Instead it parses the UPPAAL
intermediate format introduced in UPPAAL 3.6 Beta 1. 

Position tracking (the mechanism used to map an expression to some
position in the input file) has been reimplemented. The representation
of types in UTAP has been reimplemented. 

The interpreter for expressions has been removed. It was broken and
could not be fixed without reimplementing major parts of the UPPAAL
interpreter (not included in UTAP). This also means that errors
related to the range of variables or expressions are no longer
detected by the TypeChecker class.

New in 0.80

This is the version used in UPPAAL 3.6 Alpha 1. It contains a lot of
bug fixes since version 0.70. Likely there are some API
incompatibilities, but it should not be hard to adapt your program to
version 0.80. Notice that configure now accepts the --enable-cora
option to enable the extensions used by UPPAAL CORA.

New in 0.70
* This is a backport of the internal development code
* This is the parser used in Uppaal 3.4.8.
* Requires at least libxml2 2.6.10.
* The top level parser invocation functions like parseXTA now only
  run the type checker if the previous pass over the input did not
  produce any errors. This should make the parser much more robust.
* As always, we have fixed a lot of bugs.
* Most of the changes relate to the new syntax (which is used in 
  future versions of Uppaal).
* The most visible API change is that transition_t has been renamed 
  to edge_t.

New in 0.60
* This is a backport of the internal development code
* API changes include a split of SystemBuilder into several
  classes.
* Now requires at least libxml2 2.6.0.
* This is the parser used in Uppaal 3.4.6.
* Notice that header files now use a .h suffix.

New in 0.50
* Fixed bugs 32, 43, 46, 54, 58, 60, 82, 85, 88, 93, 97	and more
* Added tracer example program: Reads trace files in UPPAAL XTR format.
* Notice that some of the API has changed.

New in 0.40
* Bug fixes
* Reimplemented expression representation

New in 0.30
* Bug fixes
* Reimplementation of type and symbol handling, see the new
  symbol_t, type_t and frame_t classes.
* Reimplementation of TimedAutomataSystem construction and  
  type checking. The construction is now handled by the 
  SystemBuilder class and the type checking is done in a
  seperate pass by the new TypeChecker class.
* Range checking has been moved to another class: RangeChecker

New in 0.10
* Initial release
